1. (define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)
2. applicative order vs. normal order
3. (cond (<p1> <e1>)
		 (<p2> <e2>)
		 ...
		 (<pn> <en>))
4. (if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>)
5. Procedural abstraction => suppress detail
6. In a procedure definition, the bound variables declared as the formal parameters of the procedure have the body of the procedure as their scope
7. A procedure can have internal procedures that are local to that procedure (such nesting of definitions is called block structure)
8. The type of process characterized by a chain of deferred operations is called recursive process
9. An iterative process is one whose state can be summarized by a fixed number of state variables, together with a fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be updated as the process moves from state to state and an optional end test that specifies conditions under which the process should terminate
10. recursive process vs. recursive procedure
11.
