Cute root of x:
(x/y^2 + 2y)/3

Q: Write a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure

(define (cube-root guess x)
	(if(good-enough? guess x)
		guess
		(cube-root (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
	(/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
	(< (abs(- guess (improve guess x))) (* guess 0.001)))

Thoughts:
Only "improve" function needs to be changed
