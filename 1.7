Q: Modify good-enough? function evaluates the incremental change from guesses

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
	(if (good-enough? guess (improve guess x) x)
		guess
		(sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (good-enough? guess next-guess x)
	(< (abs(- guess next-guess)) (* guess 0.001)))

Improved:
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
	(if (good-enough? guess x)
		guess
		(sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
	(< (abs(- guess (improve guess x))) (* guess 0.001)))

Thoughts:
good-enough? already has a reference to x. no need to put (improve guess x) as parameter
